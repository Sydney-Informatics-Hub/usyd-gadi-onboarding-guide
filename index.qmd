This document contains instructions for how to access and utilise NCI's HPC, Gadi for the ANZAC Neurogenetics Group. Please be mindful this is not an exhausive resource for using the NCI Gadi HPC. It is only intended to orientate you to the ANZAC Neurogenetics Group workspace.  

NCI’s HPC systems are designed to handle complex computational tasks, such as simulations, data analysis, and modeling, for a wide range of scientific disciplines, including climate modeling, genomics, astronomy, and materials science. 

The University of Sydney provides its researchers with subsidised access to NCI’s infrastructure. To arrange user credits (service units) for your account, please contact SIH's Research Computing team through our [website](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/schemes.html).

## Support 

SIH is limited in the support it can provide for NCI Gadi users. If you are new to HPC and Gadi, we expect you will attend [SIH's Intro to HPC](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/training.artemis/) and NCI's Intro to Gadi courses. Additionally, familiarise yourself with Gadi using the [NCI Gadi user guide](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Gadi+User+Guide):

* [SIH training calendar](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training/training-calendar.html)
* [NCI training calendar](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/NCI+Training+and+Educational+Events)
