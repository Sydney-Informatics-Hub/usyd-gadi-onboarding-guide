[National Computational Infrastructure (NCI)](https://nci.org.au/our-systems) provides high performance computing (HPC), cloud computing, and data services to Australian researchers. This guide has been developed to support University of Sydney researchers in setting up their computational workflows on NCI's [Gadi HPC](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/hpc-systems).

:::{.callout-note}
Please be mindful this is not an exhaustive resource for using Gadi. It is only intended to orient you to the system and navigate the comprehensive [NCI user documentation](https://opus.nci.org.au/spaces/Help/pages/12583138/NCI+Help). See the [University of Sydney Research Computing documentation](https://sydneyuni.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RC/overview?homepageId=173932782) for more information on research computing infrastructure available at USyd.
