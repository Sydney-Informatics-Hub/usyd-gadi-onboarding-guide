[National Computational Infrastructure (NCI)](https://nci.org.au/our-systems) is a services facility that provides high performance computing (HPC), cloud computing, and data services to Australian researchers.

Our insitutional HPC 'Artemis' will be de-comissioned in August 2025. NCI has been chosen as the replacement computing platform. All staff and students with a valid University of Sydney unikey can access NCI computing time under the [NCI-Sydney Scheme](https://sydneyuni.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RC/pages/3448733944/NCI-Sydney+Scheme). 

If HPC is not suitable for your workload, please consider NCI [cloud](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Nirin+Cloud+User+Guide) or [virtual research desktops](https://are.nci.org.au/). We are confident that your research computing will be well-supported by these platforms. 

This site is focused on the use of NCI's [Gadi HPC](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/hpc-systems), in the context of University of Sydney researchers. 

Please be mindful this is not an exhaustive resource for using Gadi. It is only intended to orient you to the system and navigate the comprehensive [NCI user documentation](https://opus.nci.org.au/spaces/Help/pages/12583138/NCI+Help).


## Support

SIH is limited in the support it can provide for NCI Gadi users. If you are new to HPC and Gadi, we expect you will attend [NCI's Intro to Gadi](https://opus.nci.org.au/spaces/Help/pages/48497461/NCI+Training+and+Educational+Events) courses. Additionally, familiarise yourself with Gadi using the [NCI Gadi user guide](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Gadi+User+Guide).

Live and self-directed training is also offered by SIH and NCI on HPC and data analysis topics:

* [SIH training calendar](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training/training-calendar.html)
* [NCI training calendar](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/NCI+Training+and+Educational+Events)
