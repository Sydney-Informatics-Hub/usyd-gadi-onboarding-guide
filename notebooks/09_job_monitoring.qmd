## Job monitoring

You should monitor your jobs to keep track of their progress but refrain from checking your jobs too frequently. Repeated queries will be considered attacks, especially in quick succession and you may get a warning from NCI. NCI recommends querying your jobs' status a maximum of once every 10 minutes.

Like Artemis, you can use the `qstat` command to monitor jobs on Gadi. The NCI Gadi [job monitoring page](https://opus.nci.org.au/spaces/Help/pages/236880322/Job+monitoring...) describes some commonly used flags to qstat. 

## Job IDs

Like Artemis jobs, jobs submitted to Gadi are given a jobID. This is shown to you as soon as it has been accepted, for example `135615373.gadi-pbs`. 

When querying the job with `qstat`, you can use the full ID, or just the string of numbers (omit the `.gadi.pbs`). 

For example, the below two commands are equivalent:

```bash
qstat -xf 135615373.gadi-pbs
qstat -xf 135615373
```

If you have multiple jobs running, you do not need to check them individually with the job ID. You can check the status of multiple jobs using your NCI user ID:

```bash
qstat -u <nci-user-id>
```

## Job logs

By default, the PBS job logs will be created in the directory from which the `qsub` command was entered, and combine the `job name` and the `job ID`. 

For example, a job with `#PBS -N convert` and job ID `133703660` will have standard output and resource usage written to `convert.o133703660` and standard error written to `convert.e133703660`. 

This differs slightly to Artemis, which has the same default filepath behaviour except the standard output is sent to the <job-name>.o<job-id> and the resource usage is sent to <job-name>.o<job-id>_usage. 

The Gadi `.o` file has the resource usage at the end of the log making it easy to view a quick summary with the `tail` command:

```bash
$ tail -n 11 convert.o133703660 
```
The output should look similar to:
```default
                  Resource Usage on 2025-02-05 16:16:10:
   Job Id:             133703660.gadi-pbs
   Project:            aa00
   Exit Status:        0
   Service Units:      23.94
   NCPUs Requested:    7                      NCPUs Used: 7               
                                           CPU Time Used: 02:57:33        
   Memory Requested:   63.0GB                Memory Used: 51.14GB         
   Walltime requested: 08:00:00            Walltime Used: 02:44:09        
   JobFS requested:    100.0MB                JobFS used: 0B              
======================================================================================
```

If desired, you can change the default log filepaths with the `-o` and `-e` directives, for example:

```bash
#PBS -o ./logs/convert-fast5.o
#PBS -e ./logs/convert-fast5.e
```
This omits the job ID from being included in the log file name and sends the logs to a different directory.

When a job is submitted to one of the Gadi GPU queues (*i.e.* `gpuvolta` and `dgxa100`), the job log will also contain information related to the GPU usage (lines 9-10):
```{.default code-line-numbers="true"}
                  Resource Usage on 2025-10-03 11:05:11:

## Monitoring resource usage in real time
### Monitoring CPU jobs

To view the CPU and memory utilisation of a running job, you can use the bespoke `nqstat_anu` utility (ANU = The Australian National University, where Gadi is housed). 

By default, running the command `nqstat_anu` will report on all jobs for the current user under their **default project**, providing the following details:

- % CPU utilisation
- walltime used
- walltime requested
- RSS
- maximum memory used by the job
- memory requested
- CPUs requested
- whether the job is queued or suspended

Run `nqstat_anu -h` for more options.

## Switching default project
To change your default project, run `switchproj <nci-project-id>`, providing the ID of the project you want to switch to. If you don't know what your default project is, run the command `nci_account` with no arguments. Since `-P <nci-project-id>` is not supplied, it will report on your default project.

### Monitoring GPU jobs
NCI provides a useful utility called `gpustat` to monitor GPU utilisation. To access this tool, you need to first join the project **dk92** via MyNCI portal.

Once your request has been approved, you can follow the instructions provided on the [NCI User Guide](https://opus.nci.org.au/spaces/DAE/pages/164790536/Gpustat+-+Multinode+GPU+monitoring) to use `gpustat`. Please note that, while the `qstat` command accepts both the full and short formats of jobID, `gpustat-run` only takes the full ID string (*i.e.* including the `.gadi-pbs` part) to initialise the session.

A help information will display on your terminal when `gpustat` executes successfully. This should include a command to run on your local machine, following the format of
```bash
ssh -N -L <local port>:<Gadi GPU hostname>:<remote port> <your Gadi username>@gadi.nci.org.au
```

`gpustat` leverages SSH port forwarding (also known as SSH tunneling) to securely tunnel network connections through an encrypted SSH session. This is achieved by running the SSH command on your **local terminal** with the `-L` flag enabled. For users who are working with a CLI tool (such as a Mac or Git terminal), you can simply copy the command and then execute it. It will appear hanging because all the command does is forwarding the port so you can access the information on your local machine.

For GUI applications such as MobaXterm, you can create an SSH tunnel using its built-in SSH session manager:

1. Open MobaXterm and create a new SSH tunnel.
![MobaXterm Tunneling](../fig/mobaxterm-ssh-tunnel.png)
2. In the session settings, fill in the following information.
![Tunnel configurations](../fig/mobaxterm-ssh-tunnel-setup.png)
  - **Forwarded port**: This is the local port number you will type in your browswer (*e.g.* 3000) to access to the monitoring dashboard. It does not have to be the same number as the remote port on Gadi (which changes everytime you rerun `gpustat-run`).
  - **SSH server**: This configures the SSH server information, including the server url (gadi.nci.org.au), your gadi username (*e.g.* jf1411), and the port number (default number for SSH connection is 22).
  - **Remote server**: This includes adding the GPU server hostname (*e.g.* gadi-gpu-v100-0095) as the "Remote server" and setting the "Remote port". Such information can be both found in the `gpustat-run` output.
3. Click "Save" and then the "Start/stop" button to establish the tunnel.

Once the tunnel is established, you can access the `gpustat` web page on your local machine, *i.e.* by opening `http://localhost:<local port>` in your browser.


## Monitoring job disk usage

Each project has an allocation of physical disk space and inodes on scratch, gdata and home. When running jobs on Gadi, it's important to ensure you have sufficient allocation remaining to meet the needs of the job you are running, as exceeding the limit of these resources can cause a running job to fail. Please see the section on [disk](./06_accounting.qmd#disk) and [inode](./06_accounting.qmd#inodes) usage for more details and how to query usage of these resources.
