University of Sydney researchers are entitled to fully-subsidised access to NCI facilities through the Sydney Scheme. Access to NCI systems will be an ongoing feature of the [Sydney Research Cloud](https://intranet.sydney.edu.au/research-support/managing-research/facilities-and-tools/sydney-research-cloud.html) initiative.
