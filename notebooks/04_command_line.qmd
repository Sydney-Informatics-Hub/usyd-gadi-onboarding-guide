Working on Gadi will require you to have reasonable confidence on the Linux/Unix command line. 

## Linux command line training

NCI host a number of training sessons, including introductory Linux. Please visit their [training calendar](https://opus.nci.org.au/spaces/Help/pages/48497461/NCI+Training+and+Educational+Events). 

There are numerous self-directed training tutorials online, such as [this one from Sandbox.bio](https://sandbox.bio/tutorials/carpentries-shell-novice/).

A bash cheatsheet such as [this one from NCI](https://opus.nci.org.au/spaces/Help/pages/90308858/Linux+Command+Quick+Reference) or [this one](https://devhints.io/bash) can also be helpful in increasing your familiarity with the command line. 

Due to the plethora of high-quality introductory command line materials available online, we will not reproduce those here.
