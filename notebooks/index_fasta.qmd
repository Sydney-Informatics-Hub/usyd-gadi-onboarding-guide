We have created a very simple workflow to generate reference index files as required. The pipeline is called [IndexReferenceFasta-nf](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/IndexReferenceFasta-nf). It can be used to generate indexes for: 

* Samtools faidx
* GATK CreateSequenceDictionary
* BWA index

**1. Download a copy of the pipeline code to your Gadi environment**

A copy of this pipeline is already available at: `/g/data/<project>/pipelines`. But if you'd like to update that copy, run: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/IndexReferenceFasta-nf.git
```

Move into the directory, this is where you'll be working: 

```bash
cd IndexReferenceFasta-nf
```

**2. Generate indexes**

Follow the [user guide to generate required indexes](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/IndexReferenceFasta-nf?tab=readme-ov-file#user-guide).
