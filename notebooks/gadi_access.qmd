National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) is a services facility that provides high performance computing (HPC), cloud and data services to Australian researchers.

Gadi is the name of NCIâ€™s HPC facility, located at ANU (Canberra). The system is suitable for:

* Software that can utilise multiple nodes
* Highly CPU efficient workflows
* Scalable workflows
* Users with moderate HPC experience

## **Set up your NCI Account**

All new users must create their account through the [NCI online self service portal](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/login?next=/mancini/). To create your account you will need the following information:

- Your Name
- Institutional email address (Gmail, Hotmail, etc. are not accepted)
- Mobile phone number
- Either:
  - NCI project code of an existing project you wish to join
  - A new project proposal to be assessed by a Scheme Manager to determine if they will grant your project time

Note that resources at NCI are allocated to **projects** and not to individual users.

Complete all steps below to set up an NCI account:

1. Click on 'Sign up' link on the [NCI online self service portal](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/login?next=/mancini/):

3. Provide your personal details: 
![](../fig/gadi_step2.png)

4. Provide details on the project you'll be working on. Select `I need to join one or more existing projects`. Ask Marina for your group's project code to write in the `Projects` menu:

Your username will become active when a project Lead CI approves your request to join their project, or when a Scheme Manager approves your new project proposal. You will receive a confirmation email from the Mancini system when your username is activated.

## **Manage your NCI Account**

You can manage your account details and request access to new or existing projects through the [NCI online self service portal](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/login?next=/mancini/). 

Once your access to your group's Gadi project has been confirmed, you can set up your computer and log in to Gadi. See the [setup](../setup.qmd) instructions for how to log in to the HPC system.
