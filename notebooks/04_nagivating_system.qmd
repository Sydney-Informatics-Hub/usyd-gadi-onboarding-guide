Finding your way around Gadi's directories is straightforward once you know a few basic rules. Within these directories, you can create files and subdirectories, move your data, run your analyses, and access software.

## Some basic Linux commands

Working on any Linux-based system, including Gadi, requires a basic understanding of the command line. Here are some common commands you will need to use. Keep in mind these are case-sensitive, and can be adjusted by using flags.


- `ls` - list files and directories
- `cd` - change directory
- `pwd` - print working directory
- `mkdir` - make directory
- `cp` - copy files and directories
- `mv` - move files and directories
- `rm` - remove files and directories
- `cat` - concatenate and display files
- `less` - view files one screen at a time
- `head` - display the first few lines of a file
- `tail` - display the last few lines of a file
- `man` - display the manual page for a command

## The Gadi filesystem

![Source: https://opus.nci.org.au/spaces/Help/pages/236880086/Gadi+Resources...](../fig/gadi_system.png)

Keep these simple formats in mind as you use Gadi:

## `/home`

This is your personal home directory is always located at`/home/institution_id/username`.

## `/scratch`
Each user within a project's scratch directory will have their own workspace at `/scratch/<project>/<username>`, where you can store temporary data. You can also create new directories in your scratch space to organise your work and share across project users. 

## `/g/data`
Global data storage is similar to scratch in that each user has their own workspace this is found at `/g/data/project/username`. (Note: Not all projects include Global Data storage.)

## `/apps` 

All installed software is organised under `/apps/software/version`.
